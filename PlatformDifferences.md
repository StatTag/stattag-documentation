# StatTag Platform Differences

Although we strive for a consistent user experience on any system, given that the macOS and Windows versions of StatTag are built conceptually different (an app vs. a plug-in, respectively), there are some differences in their implementations.

The following tasks/features have different behavior on each platform, as noted.

| Task/Feature | macOS | Windows |
| ------------ | ----- | ------- |
| Double-clicking a tag in the Word document. | Nothing happens | Opens a dialog to show where in the code file the tag is defined. |
